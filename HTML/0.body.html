   <h1>CHAPTR-1<h1>
   <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
   <p>CMOS is an innovation, which has altered the universe of devices. Created more than forty years ago, the devices today has contracted to numerous requests of size. It is this scaling down that has brought about a proceeded with advancement as far as cost, execution and vitality productivity. Various reasons add to making CMOS the current best for microelectronics. Some of which incorporate the better conceivable adaptability, current reliance on channel width rather than producer territory, and low power utilization.</p>
   <p>The cutting back per segment in VLSI has been conceivable because of broad scaling of the fundamental MOS gadget. The idea of scaling proposed by Dennard has been the main impetus behind the scaling down progress accomplished in the MOSFET. The Moore's forecast of segments on an IC multiplying like clockwork has made due for more than the foreseen time yet now a period has begun where in the materialness of MOSFET is confronting handy points of confinement around the entryway length of under 30nm.</p>   
   <p>One of the promising options in contrast to CMOS innovation is the Quantum Dot Cellular Automata proposed by Lent. It presents the idea of usage of cell automata utilizing Nano size structures like quantum spots. The premise of QCA lies in the material science of the cooperation between the electrons put in the potential wells. Quantum dots frame one decision of nanostructures to be utilized in QCA.</p>
   <p>Quantum Dots are minor precious crystals made of semiconductor material also, are roughly ten thousand times smaller than a human hair. Because of the benefit of ultralow measure, QCA innovation holds a solid position as an option in contrast to CMOS innovation. The essential QCA cell comprises of a limited number of these quantum spots or metal islands in which the electrons can confine. Accurately a QCA cell contains 2N specks where N is the number of electrons, which can burrow between the quantum spots. Notwithstanding, there can be no burrowing between the cells because of the high potential hindrance. As it were, the potential wells inside a cell are associated by passage intersections that can be opened for transport of electrons.</p>

   <h4>1.1 QCA WORKING</h4>
   <p>The working component of QCA depends on the guideline of quantum mechanical borrowing between the electrons limited in the wells and the coulombic association between the electrons. The arrangement of the electrons in the QCA cell is represented by the coulomb's law as indicated by which the electrons will in general involve the situations with greatest partition due to coulombic aversion between them. This can be theoretically comprehended by thinking about the conceivable arrangements of electrons. Since the QCA cell is a square structure, the two conceivable polarizations are as appeared. The polarization of 1.00 speaks to a parallel 0 and the polarization of +1.00 speaks to a paired 1. These are the main two conceivable designs of the electrons since every single other position of electrons prompt most extreme aversion as appeared.</p>
